## Transformers
Transformers models are a type of neural network architecture which was introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. Since then, transformers have become the foundation for many state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa. Transformers are designed to handle sequential data, such as text, by processing the entire sequence at once, rather than one element at a time. This is achieved through the use of self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the importance of different elements in the input sequence when making predictions. Transformers have been shown to outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, machine translation, and question answering. They have also been successfully applied to other domains, such as computer vision and speech recognition. Transformers are highly parallelizable and can be trained efficiently on large datasets using techniques such as distributed training and mixed precision training. They have become a popular choice for many NLP researchers and practitioners due to their flexibility, scalability, and performance.

### Categories of Transformers
There are several categories of transformers models, each with its own architecture and training objective. Some of the most common categories include:

#### 1. Encoder Models (or auto-encoding models)
Encoder-only models are designed to process an input sequence and generate a fixed-size representation of the sequence. They are typically trained using unsupervised learning objectives, such as language modeling or masked language modeling.
**Use Cases**: Sentence embeddings, text classification, text clustering, etc.
**Examples**: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, etc.

#### 2. Decoder Models (or Autoregressive Models)
Autoregressive models are designed to generate text one token at a time by predicting the next token in the sequence based on the previous tokens. They are trained using a teacher-forcing approach, where the model is fed the ground-truth tokens during training but generates tokens autoregressively during inference. 
**Use Cases**: Text generation, language modeling, etc.
**Examples**: GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3, etc.

#### 3. Encoder-Decoder Models (or Seq2Seq Models)
Encoder-decoder models are designed to handle sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation and text summarization. They consist of two main components: an encoder, which processes the input sequence, and a decoder, which generates the output sequence. The encoder and decoder are typically implemented as separate transformer models that are trained jointly on parallel data. 
**Use Cases**: Machine translation, text summarization, etc.
**Examples**: BART, T5, MarianMT, etc.

Almost all transformer models are trained on large-scale datasets using unsupervised learning objectives, such as language modeling, masked language modeling, or translation modeling. These pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on specific tasks with relatively little labeled data, making them highly versatile and adaptable to a wide range of NLP tasks.

### Bais and Limitations of Transformers
While transformers have achieved remarkable success in NLP and other domains, they are not without their limitations. Some of the key biases and limitations of transformers include:
1. **Data Bias**: Transformers models are trained on large-scale datasets, which may contain biases and stereotypes present in the data. These biases can be amplified by the model during training and inference, leading to biased predictions and decisions.
2. **Interpretability**: Transformers models are often criticized for their lack of interpretability, as it can be challenging to understand how the model makes predictions and what features it is attending to. This can make it difficult to trust the model's decisions and debug errors.
