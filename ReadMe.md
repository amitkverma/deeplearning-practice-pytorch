# Pytorch implementation of DeepLearning models
I have implemented these models from scratch for learning and understanding purposes. The models are implemented in a modular way, so that it can be easily understood and modified

## Models
- [x] [Basics of tensors](/basics)
- [x] [Simple DNN model](/simple_dnn)
    - [x] [Linear Regression]()
    - [x] [Logistic Regression]()
    - [x] [Multi Layer Perceptron]()
- [ ] [Convolutional Neural Network]()
    - [x] [LeNet](/cnn/2_lenet.py)
    - [x] [AlexNet](/cnn/3_alex_net.py)
    - [x] [VGG](/cnn/4_vgg.py)
    - [x] [NiN](/cnn/5_nin.py)
    - [ ] [GoogLeNet](/cnn/6_googlenet.py)
    - [ ] [ResNet](/cnn/7_resnet.py)
    - [ ] [DenseNet](/cnn/8_densenet.py)
- [ ] [Recurrent Neural Network]() 
    - [ ] [RNN]()
    - [ ] [LSTM]()
    - [ ] [GRU]()
- [ ] [Sequence to Sequence]()
    - [ ] [Simple Seq2Seq]()
    - [ ] [Attention Seq2Seq]()
